Shopify lets merchants manage all aspects of their shops: uploading products, changing the design, accepting credit card orders, viewing their incoming orders and completed transactions, and more.

  Shopify currently hosts more than 60,000 active online retailers, including: Gatorade, Amnesty International, General Electric, Tesla Motors, LMFAO, Foo Fighters, Encyclopedia Britannica, Tata Group, etc. Shopify will take all the hassle out of building an online store, so its users can focus on what they do best: creating and selling your products and services!
