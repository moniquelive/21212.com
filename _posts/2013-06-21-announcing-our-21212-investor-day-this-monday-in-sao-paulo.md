  Our Investor Day represents a significant moment for our startups participating in our Acceleration Program, giving them the chance to present their results after months of hard work, drive and motivation. It is more than just an opportunity to potentially secure further funding, but also a time to exchange ideas, engage with knowledgeable and experienced people and continue the process of learning and gaining valuable insight.
