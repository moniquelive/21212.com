On August 17th and 18th, the Rio Mobile Hackathon event will take place here at our 21212 office in Botafogo!

The event is focused on teaching the best strategies for developing apps and games using the Corona SDK platform. Participants will work either alone or in groups throughout the two days to create their app or game for cellphones or tablets. At the end, participants will vote on the best app and game that was developed. The winning teams will receive prizes that are worth in total over R$3,000.

Don&#8217;t worry, the teams who don&#8217;t win won&#8217;t be left out&#8211; they will also receive prizes from the sponsors!

What kind of app or game you have always wanted to develop? Keep brainstorming, let your ideas flow for the next few weeks and be ready in August to turn your idea into real life!
