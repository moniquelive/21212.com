Pagpop’s founder, Marcio Campos, explained how he came up with the idea of one of the easiest and most practical ways of digital payment: an app that enable payments by credit card through a device attached to the cellphone. The idea came up during an appoitment with a patient. Formelly a surgeon dentist, Campos wanted to make his patients lives easier by creating a way of payment that could eliminate the main problem that used to happen when people paid by check: the payment defaults.

With 50 thousand customers around Brasil, the clients couldn’t be more satisfied with such a versatile app.
