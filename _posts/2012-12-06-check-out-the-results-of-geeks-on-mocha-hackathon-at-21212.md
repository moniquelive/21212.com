On the 24th and 25th of November 2012, we hosted the third edition of the Geeks on Mocha Hackathon at our office.

It was a great experience to have around 40 hackers at the 21212 office in a 30 hours event. In between all the pizza eating and energy drinks drinking, they had to work 18 hours straight in order to develop an online game. They were divided in 5 teams to brainstorm about the game&#8217;s plot and code a prototype. We were thrilled to see the results!

We had a lot of young programmers who were not even in university yet. Even so, in a short period of time, they end up proving to have great potential!
