Treebos is a network for those interested in supporting local farms and healthy eating. When customers plant a virtual tree, Treebos plants a physical fruit tree somewhere in Brazil through its network of local farmers. Treebos enables the customer to track the real tree’s growth and to receive, exchange or sell the fruit produced by the tree and other trees within Treebos’ network.
