Demo Day is less than two weeks away!  Our teams are working hard and excited to present to the leading international and Brazilian angel investors, VCs, thought leaders, media, and market insiders.

Our supporting sponsor, Airbnb is giving a hand to some of our guests coming to Rio for the event.  Airbnb is providing credit for some of our invitees for those who stay in any of Airbnb&#8217;s listings in Rio.  As we know, it&#8217;s hard to economize on a trip to Rio de Janeiro so we&#8217;re so excited that our supporting sponsor is helping us out!

Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world — online or from a mobile phone. They connect people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 26,000 cities and 192 countries. With world-class customer service and a growing community of users, Airbnb is the easiest way for people to monetize their extra space and showcase it to an audience of millions.

Thanks Airbnb for supporting us and our invitees!
