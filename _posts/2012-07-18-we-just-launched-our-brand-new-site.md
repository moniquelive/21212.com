We are excited to introduce a brand new, cleaner, and more beautiful than ever website for 21212!

In addition to a better usability, organization, and clean interface, we are empowering the most important part of 21212: our people.

Our Digital Accelerator is made up of a strong group of people so we wanted to feature our staff and network and make it easier for them to communicate. Â Now every staff member will have their own blog inside of the site, which will allow them to contribute more effectively with the communities of entrepreneurship, technology and design.

We&#8217;re also going to increase our engagement by posting more pictures and videos about what&#8217;s going on around the office.

We hope you like it!
