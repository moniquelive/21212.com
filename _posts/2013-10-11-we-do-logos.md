WeDoLogos provides clients with high-quality design solutions at a fraction of the cost of traditional agencies through a highly interactive platform. Clients are able to submit a project and provide design specifications, which We Do Logos uses to create a weeklong competition amongst its registered designers. Afterwards, clients may view all bids (an average of 30 are submitted) and pick a winning design according to their personal taste.

WeDoLogos is currently the most efficient and safe outsourcing platform in Latin America and this inspires them to expand their business. They are now working with other solutions such as website development, digital marketing, content and other digital services.
