****Eler is a Brazilian designer based in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. She is a specialist in Design Thinking, working as a consultant in personal development, business design and innovation. <b id="internal-source-marker_0.6564587119501084">She is a professor for MBA programs and graduate school. </b>****

She discussed how the world of business is changing, shifting from old business and management models to the fast pace of the digital 21st century. As a result of these changes, we often hear the term “Design Thinking” in discussions about innovation and new businesses.

Design is a “human-centric” discipline, therefore Design Thinking is heavily focused on how the user/client/person reacts and interacts with a product, service, brand, etc.

The new position of CDO (Chief of Design Officer) is more and more common among startups and even big companies seeking innovation.

This is a tendency, but the shift is still slow, only now do we have designers taking business classes and business people taking design classes.

****She compared the two mindsets:****

<em id="__mceDel"><b><b><br /> Business Thinking &#8211; Fordist model, analytical, rationalist with no long term vision</b></b></em>

-Keeping the best practices of the market

-Benchmarking

-Continuous Improvement

-Data analysis to make decisions concerning the future

-Focusing on cutting cost

****

Design Thinking &#8211; Not trading quality over price, creating emotional connections through segmented targeting.****

-Focusing on new practices

-Being the benchmark

-Being disruptive

-Exploring and creating new scenarios

-Focusing on the meaning and value for the user

<b id="internal-source-marker_0.30625750753097236"><br /> Denise explained that the new model is about including design, along with business and technology, inside the production cycle. Going from thinking and doing, to a system where you think, observe, understand, prototype and learn, much like the lean startup model.</b>
