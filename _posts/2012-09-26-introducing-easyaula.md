    <a href="http://easyaula.com.br">Easyaula</a> is an online platform that allows anyone to teach a class.  It is part of the wave that is transforming education and supplementing what we learn in school and reminding us that we should never stop learning.  Here are a few thoughts from the CEO, <a href="http://21212.com/companies/easyaula/">Diego Alvarez </a>about the company and his experience.

  <p>
    <span style="color: #888888;"><strong>What&#8217;s the philosophy behind your startup?</strong></span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <strong>Short answer:</strong> Everybody has something to teach and something to learn.
  </p>
</div>

</div>

<div>
  <p>
    The current education system doesn&#8217;t prepare people for success anymore. Non-traditional education has been a powerful alternative in helping people achieve their professional and personal goals. We believe that this non-traditional education can be democratized if everybody with some valuable knowledge is able to share and monetize that expertise.

    <span style="color: #888888;"><strong>How does Easyaula democratize non-traditional education?</strong></span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    Enabling people to learn anything from anyone. We empower people with tools and services that help them to offer classes, talks, courses and workshops, monetizing their expertise.

  <p>
    Easyaula offers many tools and services, ranging from online payment to digital marketing and support on finding a place to run the class.<br /> Students benefit from having classes of a wide range of subjects, from how to make sushi to how to accelerate your startup.

    <span style="color: #888888;"><strong>You went to ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica), how did that impact your idea to start this company?</strong></span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    ITA is the most prestigious engineering school in Brazil. I learned a lot there and built a strong engineering background and network.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    However, though I think this background will help me a lot in the long run, I couldn&#8217;t see how to apply what I was learning in classroom at work, where I had to know and deal with the latest technologies.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    To be successful and get my dream job I had to learn tons of skills outside the classroom and that motivated me to resign from the job and start Easyaula.

  </p>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    It has been the most inspiring experience I have had in my life so far. I face big challenges everyday and learn a lot from them! It&#8217;s a lot of hard (very hard) work, but seeing the results of that make our Team keep going highly motivated.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    The support and expertise offered by 21212 has been <strong>fundamental</strong> and I see a huge perspective for both of us.
