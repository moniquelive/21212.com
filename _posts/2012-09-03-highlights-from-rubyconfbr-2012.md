We’ve just had an awesome time in São Paulo attending the 5th RubyConfBR event. It was the first time we have been and we really enjoyed it!

One of the greatest things about the Ruby community is the social aspect, and this event reflected that perfectly.  We were able to meet many new people and connect with some friends.

We arrived in São Paulo on Wednesday, the day before the conference.  We enjoyed the hospitality from our friends at [Plataformatec&#8217;s](http://plataformatec.com.br/) Office.  We weren&#8217;t expecting the &#8216;pre-event&#8217; gathering they planned to have at a nearby pizza bar. It was great to meet with some of the event speakers and some brazilian geek celebrities.

  About the brazilian geek celebrities, these are people that contribute to open source projects &#8211; such as Ruby on Rails, TorqueBox, etc.
