<p dir="ltr">
  We are excited to announce our new partnership with <a href="http://customer.io/">Customer.Io</a>, a platform that enables the creation of automated emails and sophisticated newsletters.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Customer.Ioâ€™s aim is to help companies enhance their direct customer communication and service by providing a system that analyzes what people are doing on their app or website in order to automatically improve email content and design. The platform eliminates the need to do weekly database exports or write a complex built-in code, and enables user-friendly, uniquely timed and perfectly targeted emails.
</p>

We look forward to working with Costumer.Io to bring even greater efficiency and agility to our startups and help them to better satisfy their customers.
