Today we read an article from _<a title="Escape from Cubicle Nation" href="http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/" target="_blank">Escape from Cubicle Nation</a>_, a blog published by <a title="About Pamela Slim" href="http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/about-pam/" target="_blank">Pamela Slim</a>.

We though it would be nice to share it here because it brings one of our biggest learnings &#8211; the one that increases our chances of creating successful business!

Both Pam and us agree that **&#8220;_the enemy of a new entrepreneur is endless planning and  perfection_&#8220;**. As experienced entrepreneurs, we already understood that if we spend too much time thinking on how to do what we want, and even worst, if we execute our plan using a single path, our chances to get what we want are close to NONE.

So if you are an entrepreneur in an early-stage startup, and you decide that you need to have some candies in your office to make your team more motivated, how could you get it for free? Don&#8217;t waste your time preparing a huge Powerpoint deck and visiting just one candy store; call twenty stores, and do it fast! You will probably increase your chances of getting some candies for free &#8211; and following the same logic in other daily activities, you will accelerate your startup development.

In Pam&#8217;s words once more: **&#8220;_Entrepreneurship is a marathon. Train for it!_&#8220;**.
