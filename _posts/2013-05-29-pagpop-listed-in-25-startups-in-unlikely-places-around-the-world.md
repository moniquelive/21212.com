[PagPop](https://www.pagpop.com.br/‎), a 21212 alumni, recently made it to Mashable on their list of &#8220;25 Startups in unlikely places around the world.&#8221; PagPop is an online e-payment platform that allows self-employed individuals and businesses to easily and efficiently accept credit cards for their sales.  We are excited to see them make the cut and intrigued that Rio is considered an unlikely place!
