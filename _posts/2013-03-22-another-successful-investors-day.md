At 8:00 pm the doors opened and respected investors from around the world took their seats. Our 21212 founders, Marcelo, Ben, Rafael, Frederico and Jeff kicked off the event describing how 21212 is working hard to transform the digital startup ecosystem in Brazil. Following this introduction, nine entrepreneurs took the stage and pitched their ideas to an eager audience. They kept their pitches short, sweet and engaging and impactful. Three of the entrepreneurs came from companies who graduated from our previous programs: [BidCorp](http://www.bidcorp.com.br/), [EasyAula](http://www.easyaula.com.br/), and [PagPop](http://www.pagpop.com.br/). The other six were from companies from our current Acceleration Program. Here they are:
