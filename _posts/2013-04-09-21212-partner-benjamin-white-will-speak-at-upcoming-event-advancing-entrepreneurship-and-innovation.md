  We are excited to announce the America’s Society and Council will host “<a href="http://www.as-coa.org/articles/2013-latin-american-cities-conferences-rio-de-janeiro-%E2%80%93-brazil-advancing-entrepreneurship">Advancing Entrepreneurship and Innovation,</a>” a half-day conference in Rio co-organized with Rio Negócios. The event will take place on Thursday, April 11th 2013 from 9:00 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. at the Sofitel in Copacabana and will bring together entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and innovators to focus on Rio’s rapidly growing entrepreneurship ecosystem.
</p>

Keynote speakers will be Sérgio Cabral, Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro and Eduardo Paes, Mayor of the City of Rio de Janeiro. 21212 partner [Benjamin White](http://local.21212.com/people/benjamin-white/) will speak in the first panel, Entrepreneurship: Latin American Start-ups, which will discuss the opportunities and challenges entrepreneurs deal with in Brazil and Latin America including access to capital, red tape and lack of skilled workers. The following two panels will be: Can Silicon Valley be recreated in Latin America? and Innovation & Technology in Rio de Janeiro.
