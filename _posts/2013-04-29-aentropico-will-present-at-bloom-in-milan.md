  What are the main benefits Aentrópico’s services can bring for medium to large businesses?
</p>

We&#8217;re offering concrete answers to particular business concerns for business managers of medium or large businesses. Nowadays, if managers want to solve specific problems, they must buy an expensive software license, hire a team of analysts and host a powerful IT infrastructure. On top of that, these analysts will take between 3-6 months tackling a particular problem. At Aentrópico we eliminate the need of an expensive IT infrastructure and analytics team by bringing implementation times from months to weeks and increasing usability so that people without a strong mathematical/technical background can have access to sophisticated algorithms and get predictive insight to make informed data-driven decisions.

**** ****What is your view of the Big Data market in Brazil and how is it evolving?

We’re sitting on a large 10B USD Market for Business Intelligence and Analytics, which is expected to grow to 50B USD in the next 5 years. Big Data interest is growing in the whole world, Brazil is no exception. In Brazil, companies are already starting to raise awareness and express interest in becoming more data-driven. Our aim is to cater promising industries where enterprise adoption has already begun, such as retail, oil and gas and mobile. It is very interesting to see managers of different industries in Brazil already aware of their data analysis needs, but it is even more interesting to see that they see in Aentrópico exactly what they need to simplify the workflow to get intuition from data.

  What are you looking forward to at the BLOOM conference?
</p>

We&#8217;re looking forward to gain direct exposure to European Angel and VC groups. Given that some attendees will surely be industry representatives, we would like them to be early adopters of our technology and platform. Last, but not least, we&#8217;re raising our seed round and are using the event as a platform to close it in a successful way, while strengthening our ties in Europe and define an expansion strategy.
