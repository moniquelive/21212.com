Everybody knows how intense is an Acceleration Program. Many nights spent coding. Some weekends lost in meetings with mentors and advisors. Tons of hours of work!

What most people don&#8217;t know is what entrepreneurs do at their **free time** during the Acceleration Program. So we decided to show the only **&#8216;Day Off&#8217;** our entrepreneurs had during the first cycle of the 21212 Acceleration Program in Rio de Janeiro!

Check it out!
