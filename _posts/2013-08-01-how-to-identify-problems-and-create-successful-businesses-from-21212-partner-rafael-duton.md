[Rafael Duton](http://21212.com/people/rafael-duton/), one of the 21212 partners, was recently published by [Endeavor](http://www.endeavor.org.br/) in the [Exame](http://exame.abril.com.br/) in the article he wrote titled [“How to identify Problems and create Successful Businesses.](http://exame.abril.com.br/pme/noticias/como-identificar-problemas-para-criar-grandes-negocios?page=1)” He highlights the connection between photography, lean startup and entrepreneurship.

His article takes a look at the history of photography, pointing out the evolution it went through as it became increasingly more innovative. It is evident that we no longer live in the days where we have to wait hours for the film to develop from the photos we planned and set up for hours. Now, we have cell phones in our pockets and can snap a shot in any moment. We have GoPro to capture the most intense moments in extreme sports. Everyone knows that this evolution happened, but have you ever thought about why it transformed the way it did?

Rafael describes how what it really came down to, in many cases, was a problem that needed to be solved. In other words, it was lean startup methodology! We encourage you to take a few moments to read through his article and learn about the connection of photography with business, and maybe it will lead you to identifying and solving an important problem!
