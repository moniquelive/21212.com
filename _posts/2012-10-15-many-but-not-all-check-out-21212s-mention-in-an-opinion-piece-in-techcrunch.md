Yesterday, Peter Relan posted an opinion piece in TechCrunch titled, [90% of Incubators and Accelerators Will Fail and That&#8217;s Just Fine For America and the World](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/90-of-incubators-and-accelerators-will-fail-and-why-thats-just-fine-for-america-and-the-world/).  Relan founded his own incubator in the US, **YouWeb Incubator,** and discusses the abundance of incubators in the US and what he thinks are the strengths and weaknesses of incubator models.

He mentions 21212 as an example of a tech accelerator that can help the urban development in this fast growing economy.  He described in one sentence exactly what we aim to do &#8220;incubate tomorrow’s disruptors.&#8221;  Here, we have a heavy focus mentorship and strong entrepreneurs in our accelerator and a growing network that is dedicated to seeing the growth of an entrepreneurial ecosystem and we are excited to be a driver in this space!
