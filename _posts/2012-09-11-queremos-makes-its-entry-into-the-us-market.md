[Queremos!](http://www.twitter.com/queremos.), one of the thirty finalists featured at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco Startup Battlefield, presented last night.  Their platform is a revolutionary tool that put the fans in control.  It allows fans to mobilize around an artist or band and bring them to their town.  The early fans buy in to confirm the concert and then become promoters alongside the band. If the concert is sold out, they get to watch it for free!
