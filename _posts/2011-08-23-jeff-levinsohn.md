**Jeff**Â has spent his entire career advising and leading startups both from a business development and legal perspective. He has developed, structured and executed corporate partnerships that help take companies to the next level, including in the areas of digital media, consumer electronics, mobile, social gaming, enterprise software, and security systems. He&#8217;s happiest when combining his passions for working with great entrepreneurs, building positive organizations, and exploring the world (or city or country) through travel.

Jeff began his career as a tech transactions attorney for Gunderson Dettmer LLP (Silicon Valley), and has since worked as General Counsel and VP of Business Development at Sling Media (acquired by Dish Network for $380M) and Vostu (largest Brazilian social games company).
