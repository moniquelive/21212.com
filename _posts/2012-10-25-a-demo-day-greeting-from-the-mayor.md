While our Demo Day had an awesome guest list, not everyone who wanted to be there could.

Eduardo Paes, the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro couldn&#8217;t make it but sent a video message for the startups and investors.

He congratulated our startups on  presenting at Demo Day and talked a bit about Rio&#8217;s development in the technology sectors and what we can expect in the years to come!

Among other points, he mentioned that Rio is building one of the largest fiber optics networks in the world.  First class media and data centers are all coming to the city and research and technology areas continue to grow.  He excited the crowd right before Marcelo Haddad of Rio negocios announced the launch of Rio Digital.
