Currently, there is no established framework to govern internet usage. With no guidelines, the internet has not been a fair playing field for integrators and bloggers and unjust court decisions have risen, blaming, for example, website owners for comments posted by users.

The Marco Civil started in 2007 as an online platform with the objective of gathering as many people together as possible to comment and discuss openly what they felt  should be instituted in a fair, all-encompassing  internet law. For the first time in Brazil, the platform created a free, public debate about a law where all kinds of internet users  were able to share their opinions.  They have received broad social participation from over 2,000 contributors, including representatives from NGO’s, universities and governmental bodies. The themes of the Marco Civil were defined as: freedom of speech, privacy, right of access, protection, neutrality of the web and government data.

The Marco Civil has been recognized internationally as an innovative initiative that promotes democratic participation and encourages an unbiased, equal internet. We hope you will check out more information and share your opinions about what you feel should be instituted in an internet law.
