In the last three blog posts, we posted videos of our companies’ presentations at the second 21212 Demo Day.

Last, but not least, we would like to share with you our final company presentations: Access Club and Zona Universitaria.

[The Access Club](http://21212.com/companies/access-club/) is a private, invite-only, social network, that provides exclusive offline benefits through an online platform. With the comfort and convenience of the Access Card subscribers will be able to access (permanently) all the privileges, such as late check-outs and category upgrades at hotels and resorts, free gifts at top brands and restaurants, skipping to the front of the line at nightclubs and VIP events. Access Club wants to give their members the best experiences possible.



[Zona Universitaria](http://21212.com/companies/zona-universitaria/) is a social marketplace for Brazilian university students. This platform helps students construct a “map of achievements” capturing all of their career goals in a structured plan they can follow and share with others to get help. Once we they where students want to go, they help them find educational and professional opportunities they might not otherwise have known existed based on their goals and give them real world rewards once they achieve their goals.



Thank you for watching, we hope you enjoyed it!
