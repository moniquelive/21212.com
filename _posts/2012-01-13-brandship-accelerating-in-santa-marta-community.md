[Brandship](http://21212.com/companies/brandship/ "Brandship") went to Santa Marta Community in Botafogo to have lunch today and wants to help a local entrepreneur to use digital media.

<!--more ..I want to read more about that!-->

Bar do Zequinha used to be a lookout for local drug-dealers but today lots of tourists go there to lunch and chill out during a guided tour to that community. The fried chicken is terrific but our entrepreneurs chose the pork chops instead plus all the trimmings (rice, beans, salad and &#8211; since we are in Brazil &#8211; farofa and fritas &#8211; the local french fries). The fries are delicious &#8211; remembers Renny Pereira, Brandship&#8217;s Chief of Design. Zequinha serves bier in the right temperature (extremly cold!) and the place is near the inclined plane&#8217;s third station.

Don&#8217;t be afraid to be lost in the narrow streets of the community, the locals are always happy to help. The company has added the bar in Foursquare and Andre Nakamura, co-founder of Brandship, says that he will fight to be the mayor! This is only the beginning: the startup will lunch there again next week, but now with the 21212 team!
