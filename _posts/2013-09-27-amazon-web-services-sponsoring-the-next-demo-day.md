We are proud to announce that Amazon Web Services will be sponsoring our upcoming [Demo Day](http://demoday.21212.com/), which will take place on the next week, October 3rd.

<p dir="ltr">
  Since 2006, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> has been operating in the market providing Cloud Computing services, such as apps and social games, to users all around the world. With a low-cost infrastructure, a platform on the cloud, a beyond-flexible capacity, and the agility to develop and deploy applications faster, Amazon gathers customers across all sectors.
</p>

Once again, Amazon will be providing the support to make Demo Day happen. Less than one week away from the big event, we are really excited to have them as a sponsor.
