  We have already started our countdown to the next Demo Day! Within a few weeks, on October 3rd, the event will take place at Espaço Tom Jobim in Jardim Botanico, Rio de Janeiro.
</p>

The startups are really excited to pitch to an audience that includes leading international and Brazilian investors, market insiders, VCs, thought leaders, mentors, and the press. We at 21212 look forward to presenting the potential of our entrepreneurs, who have worked hard during the acceleration program and have obtained great results in the market.

In addition to the entrepreneur pitches, the agenda of the event includes the participation of keynote speakers aimed to discuss brazilian economic growth as well as the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Brazil.

After two editions of Demo Day on [March](http://21212.com/blog/the-first-21212-demo-day/) and [October 2012](http://21212.com/blog/the-2nd-demo-day/) (and other two editions of our smaller event focused on investors, [the Investor Day RJ](http://21212.com/blog/another-successful-investors-day/) and [SP](http://21212.com/blog/a-successful-21212-investor-day-in-sao-paulo/)), we are expecting the event to be a huge success. We are giving our best to bring together the most important players on the national digital scene and gather the hottest companies who are leading the culture of innovation in Brazil.
