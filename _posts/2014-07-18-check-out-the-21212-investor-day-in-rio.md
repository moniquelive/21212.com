Yesterday we held another edition of our 21212 Investor Day, in Rio de Janeiro. First, we want to thank everyone who was able to make it out to our event. We are fortunate to have such a dedicated, passionate community of entrepreneurs, investors, mentors and staff, and we value the opportunity to bring everyone together.

The event wouldn’t have been possible without our sponsors IBM and Movile, who are supporting our program during 2014.

EVENT HIGHLIGHTS

Two of our 21212 founders, Benjamin White and Marcelo Sales, took the stage to welcome everyone and explain how our Investor Day is a critical moment for startups to gain exposure, hear new insight and discuss future funding possibilities. Following this, Antonio Amaral gave an overview of the 21212 Investment Circle, an opportunity for investors to invest in 21212.

We also had the pleasure to welcome one of Y Combinator&#8217;s part-time partners, Michael Seibel, who was previously a successful entrepreneur as founder and CEO of Justin.tv (2007-2011) and Socialcam (2012). <a title="Michael Seibel" href="http://www.michaelseibel.com/" target="_blank">Read more about Michael here</a>.
